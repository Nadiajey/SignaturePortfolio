**Senior Capstone Reflection – Nadia Jeylani**

When I first started at the University of St. Thomas, I didn’t fully know where computer science would take me. I just knew I liked problem-solving, figuring out how things work, and building things from scratch. Over time, through a lot of trial and error (and many long nights debugging), I started to realize that CS wasn’t just about coding it was a way of thinking. It taught me how to break big problems into manageable pieces and how to keep going when things don’t work the first (or fifth) time.

Along the way, I picked up a minor in statistics. I’ve always liked working with numbers, and stats helped me look at problems differently not just “how do I build this,” but “what’s the story in this data?” That mindset shaped some of the projects I’ve included in this portfolio.

One of the projects I’m proudest of is a health and lifestyle analysis from my data science course. We looked at how things like sleep, exercise, and diet were linked to BMI. It sounds simple, but once you dig in, you see how small habits connect to bigger health outcomes. That made me think about how the work we do in class can actually apply to people’s lives. It's not just theoretical — it’s useful.

Another project came from a creative coding class, where I built an interactive visual sketch. It was completely different from my usual work — less technical, more about aesthetics and experience. That project reminded me that code can be expressive too. It doesn’t always have to be efficient or functional sometimes it can just be interesting or fun.

I also worked on a group project related to sustainability. We built a small game and used data models to explore how countries manage energy. It wasn’t perfect, but it got us thinking about how tech can help us understand global issues and maybe even educate others in the process.

What ties these projects together is that they all made me think beyond the assignment. They made me ask: “Why does this matter?” That’s something I’ve taken seriously at St. Thomas. The university talks a lot about the common good, and while that sounded abstract at first, I get it now. It means using what we’ve learned to do something useful, thoughtful, or positive — not just for a grade, but for people.

Faith has also been part of this journey. There were definitely times I felt overwhelmed or uncertain, but prayer and reflection helped me keep going. I’ve learned to trust the process, even when I couldn’t see where it was headed. That kind of quiet confidence — that’s something I’ll carry with me.

Looking back, I’m grateful for how much I’ve learned not just in terms of skills, but also in how I approach problems, how I collaborate with others, and how I stay grounded in my values. This portfolio is a small piece of that bigger picture. It’s a collection of work I’ve put time and care into, and each part represents growth in a different way.

As I get ready to graduate, I’m not 100% sure what’s next and that’s okay. I feel ready for whatever comes because I know how to learn, how to adapt, and how to make what I do meaningful.
