Senior Capstone Signature Work Portfolio - Nadia Jeylani

When I first started at the University of St. Thomas, I didn’t fully know where computer science would take me. I just knew I liked problem-solving, figuring out how things work, and building things from scratch. Over time, through a lot of trial and error (and many long nights debugging), I started to realize that CS wasn’t just about coding. It was a way of thinking. It taught me how to break big problems into manageable pieces and how to keep going when things don’t work the first or fifth time.

Along the way, I picked up a minor in statistics. I’ve always liked working with numbers, and stats helped me look at problems differently not just “how do I build this,” but “what’s the story in this data?” That mindset shaped some of the projects I’ve included in this portfolio.

One project I worked on was a health and lifestyle analysis in my data science course. We looked at habits like sleep, diet, and exercise, and how they relate to BMI. It made me realize that even a class assignment could apply to real life. That was the first time I really saw how statistics and data can help people better understand their own choices and health.

In another class, I created an interactive music visualizer for my creative coding final. The sketch reacts to the beat and energy of a song, changing shapes and colors based on the sound. It was a big shift from my usual workless about logic and more about visuals and experience. That class reminded me that code can also be creative. It doesn’t always need to be practical or solve a problem. Sometimes, it can just be something someone enjoys.

I also worked on a group project in my artificial intelligence course that focused on sustainability. We created simple games that made people think about things like water access and energy use. We also used global data to group countries by how much they rely on renewable resources. The code itself wasn’t that complicated, but it showed me that even basic tools can be used to get people thinking about important issues.

Across all of these projects, I’ve learned that coding is more than just getting something to work. It’s about using what you’ve learned to make something meaningful. Whether it’s helping people make better health choices, creating something that connects with them through music, or encouraging them to think differently about the environment, there’s always a bigger reason behind the work.

Being at St. Thomas helped me see that. At first, the phrase “common good” sounded a little vague, but now I understand what it means. It’s not just about doing well in school or getting good grades. It’s about taking what you’ve learned and using it in a way that helps others. That mindset has shaped how I think about my future.

Faith has also played a big part in my time here. There were definitely moments where I felt lost, unsure of my path, or overwhelmed. During those times, prayer and reflection gave me clarity and helped me keep going. I’ve learned to be patient with the process and to trust that even when I don’t see the full picture, things will work out.

Now that I’m getting ready to graduate, I feel proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve learned more than just technical skills. I’ve learned how to stay curious, how to adapt when things change, and how to approach problems with a mindset that’s both thoughtful and practical. This portfolio is just a small sample of that growth, but it reflects the care and effort I’ve put into my time here.

As I look ahead, I’m excited to keep learning, to keep growing, and to keep creating work that has purpose.
