# Healthy Lifestyle Analysis (DASC 400)

This project explored how everyday lifestyle habits relate to BMI and overall health outcomes. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I applied decision trees and k-means clustering to uncover patterns in variables like sleep, exercise, diet, and alcohol consumption. The goal was to identify combinations of behaviors that predict higher or lower health risks.

### Tools & Techniques:
- JMP Pro 18
- Decision Tree Classification
- K-Means Clustering
- BMI Categorization (CDC Guidelines)

###  Key Insights:
- Short sleep and high alcohol use were linked to obesity
- Exercise over 7 hours/week aligned with healthier BMI
- Clustering revealed 3 distinct lifestyle profiles

### Reflection:
This project helped me connect statistical techniques with real-world health challenges. It made me think critically about how data can be used to support public wellness and preventative health strategies especially for students.
