# Creative Coding Final Project  
**Course: Creative Coding (Spring 2024)**  
**Project Type: Interactive Sketch with p5.js**

This project was created as the final assignment for my Creative Coding course. The objective of the class was to use code not just as a tool for building systems or solving problems, but as a medium for expression — to think of programming as an art form. This project gave me a chance to explore that idea in full by designing and coding a browser-based interactive sketch using the p5.js framework.

Unlike most other programming projects I’ve done, this one wasn’t focused on functionality or efficiency. It was focused on creating an experience — something visual, interactive, and engaging. The sketch I built responds to mouse movement, generating patterns that shift in color and shape in real time. It creates a kind of digital painting space, where the user doesn’t control specific actions but instead influences how the piece evolves based on their motion.

I started this project with a simple idea: I wanted the movement of the mouse to feel like “brushing” color across a canvas. To do that, I played around with randomness, transparency, layering, and motion. I used `mouseX` and `mouseY` values to control aspects of the visuals — the placement of shapes, their speed, and their size. I also incorporated some basic animation loops to keep the canvas feeling alive, even when the user isn’t actively moving the mouse.

What surprised me the most about this process was how iterative it was. There were many times when a small code change produced something unexpected — sometimes messy, sometimes beautiful. Instead of feeling frustrated, I leaned into those moments and started seeing them as creative opportunities. I began to treat bugs or odd results not as errors but as design tools. This was a big shift from how I usually approach code, where the goal is often to control every outcome. In this case, unpredictability became part of the fun.

Another big lesson was learning to work visually. Most of my computer science classes have focused on algorithms, logic, or data structures — all very left-brain, structured thinking. This project was the opposite. I had to think in terms of shape, flow, color, and timing. I had to step back and ask myself questions like, “How does this feel?” or “Does this look right?” It wasn’t about correctness — it was about creating something interesting, something that someone might enjoy interacting with, even if just for a moment.

I also gained experience working in the p5.js online editor, which provided a fast, intuitive way to test my ideas. Because the editor compiles and runs code instantly in the browser, I could tweak variables, change colors, or adjust behavior in real time. This made it easier to be playful and experimental, which matched the spirit of the assignment perfectly. It also helped me build confidence in making creative decisions without overthinking the technical side.

One of the unexpected challenges was deciding when the project was “done.” Unlike more traditional assignments where success is defined by whether the program runs correctly, this one felt more open-ended. I kept wanting to add more — more shapes, more movement, more effects. Eventually, I had to step back and evaluate whether the project fulfilled its original goal: to make something reactive, engaging, and expressive. Once I felt it did, I focused on polishing what I had instead of constantly adding.

Looking back, this was one of the most unique and enjoyable projects I’ve worked on during my time at St. Thomas. It reminded me that code doesn’t always have to be about solving problems or automating tasks. It can also be a way to express personality, emotion, and creativity. It can be messy and fun and surprising. And maybe most importantly, it can help connect us — not just through function, but through feeling.

I think this project reflects an important part of my learning journey. It shows that I’m capable of using my technical background in a variety of ways — not just for logic-heavy applications, but for design, user experience, and artistic expression too. It opened a door to a different kind of programming, and it reminded me that there’s value in exploring that space, even if it’s outside the traditional computer science path.
