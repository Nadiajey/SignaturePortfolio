# Creative Coding Final Project (Creative Coding – Spring 2024)

This was my final project for Creative Coding. For the assignment, we were told to create something interactive using p5.js. We had a lot of creative freedom, so I decided to make a sketch that responds to music.

The idea was to have visuals that change based on sound. I used a song as input, and then built out waveforms and particles that move with the beat. The visuals react to how loud the music is and to the rhythm, so it feels like the sketch is kind of dancing along with it. As the music plays, you can see the shapes shift and bounce depending on what's going on in the song. It turned into something fun to watch, especially when the beat picks up.

I built it using the p5.js web editor, which made it easy to try things out as I went. I didn’t really start with a solid plan. I just wanted it to look cool and move with the music, so I kept adjusting the visuals until it matched the energy I wanted. There were a lot of little changes I made along the way. Sometimes something would look off or not move right, so I’d change the size or timing and keep testing until it worked.

What I liked most about this project is that it didn’t feel like a regular programming assignment. It wasn’t about solving a problem or writing perfect code. It was more about experimenting and seeing what I could make. It reminded me that code can be used to express things too, not just to build tools or apps. I felt like I was making something personal, even though it was all done in code.

I also liked that it connected to music. It made the project feel more alive, and more fun to test. I would play different songs just to see how the visuals would react, and sometimes it looked completely different depending on the beat and the vibe. That was one of the coolest parts seeing how the same code gave different results depending on the music.

### What I Used:
- JavaScript with the p5.js library  
- p5.js Sound library  
- p5.js online editor

### What I Learned:
- How to use audio input to control visuals  
- That I don’t always need a detailed plan to start a project  
- That coding can be creative and artistic  
- How trial and error can lead to better results
