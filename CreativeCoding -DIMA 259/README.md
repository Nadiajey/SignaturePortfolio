# Creative Coding Final Project  
**Course: Creative Coding – Spring 2024**

This was the final project for my Creative Coding class, and honestly, it was one of the most enjoyable assignments I’ve done at St. Thomas. We were asked to create something interactive using p5.js — a JavaScript library made for visual and creative projects. The point wasn’t to build something functional or solve a problem, but just to make something interesting and interactive that responds to the user.

My idea was pretty simple at first: I wanted to build a sketch that reacts to how someone moves their mouse. As they move it across the screen, the colors shift and shapes are drawn in random patterns. It sort of feels like painting in motion — nothing you can really “control,” but you’re guiding it. No two runs of the sketch are exactly the same.

To build it, I used the p5.js web editor and played around with how mouseX and mouseY values could control the visuals. I didn’t go into it with a big plan, so a lot of it came together through experimenting. I would try something, see what it looked like, then tweak it until I liked the result. Sometimes I’d get weird outcomes that actually looked cool, so I kept them. That process was a big part of the fun — just seeing what worked and going with it.

What stood out to me was how different this felt from my usual computer science projects. Normally I’m trying to make things efficient or accurate, but this time I just focused on whether it looked and felt good. It took me out of that mindset of writing “correct” code and let me just create something. It reminded me that code doesn’t always have to be serious or practical — it can be expressive too.

I also really liked how fast the feedback loop was. Since everything ran in the browser, I could see changes right away. That made it easy to try small adjustments without overthinking. I’d move things around, change colors, switch the order of shapes, and just see what happened. It felt like the most relaxed kind of coding I’ve done — like sketching or doodling, but with code.

By the end, I had something that looked cool and felt responsive, even though it wasn’t complex in terms of logic. It made me appreciate how even simple code can create something meaningful or fun. That was kind of the point of the class, I think — to explore what code can do outside of traditional rules or expectations.

### What I Used:
- JavaScript (p5.js library)
- p5.js web editor

### What I Learned:
- Coding can be creative — not just logical or problem-solving
- You don’t always need a big plan to make something good
- Being experimental with code can lead to cool surprises
- How to use p5.js and work in a visual programming space
