# Sustainability and Energy Project  
**Course: Artificial Intelligence**

This project came from my AI class. We were asked to explore AI ideas by applying them to something meaningful, and my group decided to focus on sustainability. We ended up building two small games and doing some analysis using real-world data on energy use across different countries.

The first game we built was a version of Tic Tac Toe. In our version, the player represents pollution and the computer represents nature. It sounds a little dramatic, but the idea was to show a conflict between human behavior and the environment. We used a smart strategy for the computer opponent so it would be difficult to beat. Even though the game was simple, we liked how it told a small story through something familiar.

The second game was about water access. You’re given a grid with houses placed randomly, and your job is to place water wells so every house is covered. It was based on some basic logic and decision-making. The challenge was figuring out where to place things in the most efficient way. It was a good reminder of how problems in the real world aren’t always about winning, but about making sure everyone gets what they need.

The final part of the project was data modeling. We used a dataset about global energy and environmental indicators and tried to group countries by how renewable their energy sources were. We used decision trees and clustering to spot patterns in the data. It wasn’t perfect, and we didn’t come up with world-changing answers, but the process helped us understand how even simple models can reveal interesting trends.

Overall, I really liked how this project combined different pieces. It wasn’t just about coding, and it wasn’t just about theory. We had to think about how our work connected to real issues, and we had to figure out how to explain it in a way that made sense. It also taught me a lot about working with a team and finding balance when people have different ideas.

### What I Used:
- Python and Tkinter to build the games  
- Real-world global energy data  
- Decision trees and basic clustering

### What I Learned:
- How to take AI ideas and turn them into something people can interact with  
- That you don’t need something complicated for it to be meaningful  
- Teamwork matters just as much as the technical stuff  
- Real-world data isn’t always clean or simple, but there’s still a lot to learn from it

Looking back, this was one of the most well-rounded projects I’ve worked on. It gave me a chance to be creative and technical at the same time, and it helped me see how code can be used to bring attention to bigger topics. That’s something I want to carry with me going forward.
